/* 
	DEFAULT TEMPLATE LESS
	THERE IS NOTHING YOU NEED TO DO HERE UNLESS YOU WANT 
	TO ADD SOME MORE LESS OR CSS FILES TO BE COMPILED IN 
	template.css 
	lessphp compiler is modifyed to compile all your @import "file.css" 
	files also. Meaning that if in any of your css files 
	you have @import "file.css" it will be recompiled within template.css file
	This way you can just go head and change your default css file the way 
	you did before. If you want to add some LESS vars or include something else in here 
	feel free to come back.
